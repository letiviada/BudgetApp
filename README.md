# BudgetApp
I have created a Budget App using Python's user interface framework Tkinter. 

 The app's user interface is built using Tkinter, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the app. The interface includes a menu bar, where users can access different features of the app, such as adding transactions.
Users can add transactions by entering the date, description, category, and amount of the transaction. The app stores this information in a database using Sqlite, which provides a lightweight and reliable database solution.
The app allows users to categorize their transactions into different categories, such as food, transportation, entertainment, etc. 
The app provides a secure login system to protect users' personal financial information.
